# COMP 4300 - Assignment 2
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Program Specification
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Player:
- The player is represented by a shape which is defined in the config file
- The player must spawn in the center of the screen at the beginning of the game, and after it dies (collides with an enemy)
- The player moves by a speed read from the config file in these directions:
  - Up: W key
  - Left: A key
  - Down: S key
  - Right: D key
- The player is confined to move only within the bounds of the window
- The player will shot a bullet toward the mouse pointer when the left mouse button is clicked. The speed, size, and lifespan of the bullets are read from the config file.

* Special Ability:
- You are free to come with your own 'special move' which is fired by the player when the right mouse button is clicked. This special ability must:
  - Multiple entities (bullet etc) spawned by special weapon
  - Entities have some unique graphic associate with them
  - A unique game mechanic is introduced via a new component
  - A 'cooldown timer' must be implement for the special weapon
The properties of the special move are not in the config file.

* Enemy(s):
- Enemies will spawn in a random location on the screen every X frames, where X is defined in the config file. (FPS of the game is set to 60)
- Enemies must not overlap the sides of the screen at the time of spawn
- Enemies shape have random number of vertices, between a given minimum and maximum number, which is specified in the config file
- Enemy shape radius will be specified in the config file
- Enemies will be given a random color upon spawning
- Enemies will be given a random speed upon spawning, between a minimum and a maximum value specified in the config file
- When an enemy reaches the edge of the window, it should bounce off in the opposite direction at the same speed
- When (large) enemies collide with a bullet or player, they are destroyed, and N small enemies spawn in its place, where N is the number of vertices of the original enemy. Each small enemy must have the same number of vertices and color of the original enemy. These small entities travel outward at angles at a fixed intervals equal to (360 / vertices). For example, if the original enemy had 6 sides, the smaller enemies will travel outward in intervals of (360/6 = 60 degress)

* Score:
- Each time an enemy spawns, it is given a score component of N * 100, where N is the number of vertices it has. Small enemies get double this value.
- If a player bullet kills an enemy, the game score is increased by the score component of the enemy killed
- The score should be displayed with the font specified by the config file in the top-left corner of the screen

* Drawing:
- In the render system, all entities should be given a slow rotation, which makes the game look a little nicer
- Any Entity with a lifespan is currently alive, it should have its Color alpha channel set to a ratio depending on how long it has left to live. For example, if an Entity has a 80 frame life span, and 25 frames remaining, its alpha should be set to (float)25/80 * 255. The alpha should go from 255 when it is first spawned, to 0 on the last frame it is alive

* GUI:
You must construct a GUI using ImGui which has the following functionality:
- The GUI must display options to turn off each system independently
- For each entity in the game, the GUI must list the ID, tag, and position of that entity. You must display a list of all entities, as well as lists of entities by their tag. You must also have some way of destroying a given entity by interacting with the UI element associated with it
- You must be able to change the enemy spawn interval through the GUI
- You must be able to manually spawn enemies in some way through the GUI

## Configuration File:
- The configuration file will have one line each specifying the window size,
  font format, player, bullet specification, and enemy specifications.

Window W H FL FS
- This line declares the the SFML Window must be constructed with width W
  and height H, each of which will be integers. FL is the frame limit that the
  window should be set to, and FS will be an integer which specifies whether to
  display the application in full-screen mode (1) or not (0).

Font F S R G B
- This lines defines the font which is to be used to draw text
  for this program. The format of the line is as follows:
  ```
  Font File     F       std::string (it will have no spaces)
  Font Size     S       int
  RGB Color     R G B   int int int
  ```
